# Security Assesment BeaRex

Date: Sep 6, 2022

# Executive Summary

This report has been prepared for BeaRex to discover vulnerabilities and issues in the source code of the BeaRex smart contracts as well as any contract dependencies that were not part of an officially recognized library. A comprehensive assesment has been performed, utilizing Static Analysis, Dynamic Analysis and Manual Review techniques.

During the audit process, special attention is paid to the following considerations:

- Assessing the codebase to ensure compliance with current industry standards and best practices in smart contract development.
- Testing the smart contracts against common and uncommon attack vectors.
- Ensuring contract logic meets the specifications and intentions of the client.
- Cross referencing contract structure and implementation against similar smart contracts produced by industry leaders.
- Thorough line-by-line manual review of the entire codebase by industry experts.

The security assessment resulted in findings that ranged from critical to low severity. We suggest addressing these findings to achive a higher level of security standards and best practices. We offer recommendations that could better serve the project from the security perspective:

- Enhance general coding practices for better structures of source codes;
- Add enough unit tests to cover the possible use cases;
- Provide more comments per each function for readability, especially contracts that are verified in public repos;
- Provide more transparency on privileged activities once the protocol is live.

## 游린 CRITICAL

### BRX-1: Broken redeem

---

The method `BearExNFT._redeemToken` removes the wrong NFT from the `tokensForRedeem[_].nftIds` array.

A user can get random NFT by calling `RedeemNFT` at https://github.com/primadg/bearex/blob/ee13abadf4330cb0d48d98d5f4761734352eca1b/BearExNFT.sol#L71

`RedeemNFT` calls `_redeemToken` to extract a token id from `tokensForRedeem[rarity].nftIds` array.

It should remove a choosen element from the array but instead it simply decreases the array's length and leave a choosen element in place:
https://github.com/primadg/bearex/blob/ee13abadf4330cb0d48d98d5f4761734352eca1b/BearExNFT.sol#L139-L142

Thus, the next user who calls `BearExNFT._redeemToken` may receive a token that has already been assigned to another user because there is no check in `RedeemNFT` that the token has already been redeemed.

#### Recommendations

_1._ To remove a choosen element from the array it is recommended to swap the chosen element with the last one and then decrease the array's length:

```solidity
// choose an element
tokenPosition = random() % tokensForRedeem[rarity].totalTokensToRedeem;
tokenToRedeem = tokensForRedeem[rarity].nftIds[tokenPosition];

// remove the element
uint256 lastIndex = tokensForRedeem[rarity].totalTokensToRedeem - 1;
uint256 lastElement = tokensForRedeem[rarity].nftIds[lastIndex];

tokensForRedeem[rarity].nftIds[tokenPosition] = lastElement;
tokensForRedeem[rarity].nftIds[lastIndex] = 0;  // gas refund
tokensForRedeem[rarity].totalTokensToRedeem--;
```

_2._ `RedeemNFT` should check that the token has already been redeemed before.

#### Status

Resolved

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### BRX-2: The project has no tests

---

Any changes to the code before the contract is deployed to the network can break the intended logic of the contract and no one will know about it until users encounter a problem.

#### Recommendations

It is recommended to write tests covering the core business logic of the contract:

- deploying the contract;
- minting an NFT;
- redeeming an NFT;
- ensuring that the redeemed NFT was correctly removed from the queue of redeemable tokens.

#### Status

Resolved

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## 游릲 HIGH

### BRX-3: Double redeem

---

An owner of the contract can call `addTokensToRedeem` to add an already redeemed NFT back to the queue of redeemable tokens:
https://github.com/primadg/bearex/blob/ee13abadf4330cb0d48d98d5f4761734352eca1b/BearExNFT.sol#L126

The method `RedeemNFT` doesn't check that the NFT was already redeemed by some user and just assigns it to another.

#### Recommendations

1. `addTokensToRedeem(rarity, tokenId)` should revert if the token was already added to the queue or if it was redeemed.
2. `RedeemNFT` should revert if the user gets a token that has already been redeemed by another user.

#### Status

Resolved

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## 游릳 MEDIUM

#### BRX-4: BearExNFT shadows `_tokenURIs`

---

BearExNFT contract has a public variable `_tokenURIs` that shadows a private variable `_tokenURIs` from ERC721URIStorage:
https://github.com/primadg/bearex/blob/ee13abadf4330cb0d48d98d5f4761734352eca1b/BearExNFT.sol#L18

This may confuse the developer which may lead to mistakes in the code. Removing this variable and replacing it with the existing ERC721URIStorage `tokenURI` and `_setTokenURI` methods will also save gas.

#### Recommendations

Remove the public variable `_tokenURIs` and use ERC721URIStorage `tokenURI` and `_setTokenURI` methods instead.

#### Status

Resolved

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### BRX-5: Insecure random

---

A random token is selected for the user using the `random` function:
https://github.com/primadg/bearex/blob/ee13abadf4330cb0d48d98d5f4761734352eca1b/BearExNFT.sol#L95

It uses `block.difficulty` and `block.timestamp` as a source of randomness. Those parameters are predictable and the last one can easily be manipulated by a miner.

#### Recommendations

Either use random oracles (Chainlink) or accept the risk that a miner can non randomly redeem tokens for himself.

#### Status

Acknowleged

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### BRX-6: `addTokensToRedeem` missing check

---

The method `addTokensToRedeem` doesn't check that a `tokenId` was minted:
https://github.com/primadg/bearex/blob/ee13abadf4330cb0d48d98d5f4761734352eca1b/BearExNFT.sol#L126

This means that a non-existent tokenId could be added to the queue of redeemable tokens.

#### Recommendations

Add a check.

#### Status

Resolved

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## 游릱 LOW

### BRX-7: Save gas in `_redeemToken`

---

The line https://github.com/primadg/bearex/blob/ee13abadf4330cb0d48d98d5f4761734352eca1b/BearExNFT.sol#L142 doesn't do anything:

```solidity
tokensForRedeem[rarity].nftIds[tokensForRedeem[rarity].totalTokensToRedeem];
```

#### Recommendations

Fix or remove the line.

#### Status

Resolved

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### BRX-8: `addRedeemGroup` can overwrite an existing group

---

The method `addRedeemGroup(rarityId)` at https://github.com/primadg/bearex/blob/ee13abadf4330cb0d48d98d5f4761734352eca1b/BearExNFT.sol#L142 doesn't check that `rarityId` may already exist.

#### Recommendations

Add a check.

#### Status

Resolved

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### BRX-9: `rarityId` is not used in `mintPassContract.burnFromRedeem`

---

The method `burnFromRedeem` always uses `rarityId=1`:
https://github.com/primadg/bearex/blob/ee13abadf4330cb0d48d98d5f4761734352eca1b/BearExBox.sol#L45

```solidity
_burn(account, 1, 1);
```

#### Recommendations

It seems that the developers forgot to add the `rarityId` parameter to the `burnFromRedeem` method.

#### Status

Resolved

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
